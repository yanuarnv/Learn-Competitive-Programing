## 📅 1-Month CP Plan (Python)

| Sprint | Topic                          | Key Concepts                         | Status  |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| 1      | Arrays & Hashing               | Hash maps, frequency, brute force    | ✅ Done |
| 2      | Two Pointers & Sliding Window  | Optimization, window sizing          | ✅ Done |
| 3      | Binary Search & Prefix Sums    | Divide and conquer, precomputation   | 🔄 In Progress |
| 4      | Recursion & Backtracking       | DFS, subsets, permutations           | ⏳ To Do |

## 📌 Sample Problem: Two Sum

**Problem**: [LeetCode #1 – Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)  
**Topic**: Arrays + Hashing

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

📓 Key Learnings
Efficient use of hash maps improves time from O(n²) → O(n)

Sliding window patterns avoid unnecessary repeated work

Binary search requires careful handling of low, high, and mid

Recursion and backtracking need base cases and pruning

🔗 External Tools Used
